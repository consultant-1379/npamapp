            Network Privileged Access Management (NPAM) allows
            the creation and the maintenance of the Maintenance Users (MU) of the node directly by ENM.
        </p>

        <p>
            The Maintenance User is a user configured locally on the node, and its credentials can be used to connect to the node
             with high privileges for maintenance activities.
        </p>
        <p>For each Network Element managed by the NPAM application, an NE Account object is created for each Maintenance User to 
        store its credentials and status.</p>
        <p>The NPAM feature is disabled by default and it must be enabled by a Security Administrator.
         There is also the option to enable a second Maintenance User to support the CBRS (Citizens Broadband Radio Service) functionality.
         Use the System Security Configuration UI interface for NPAM configuration management.</p>

        <p>From NPAM application, the following use-cases are available:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Create NE Accounts</li>
                <li>Detach NE Accounts</li>
                <li>Rotate NE Account Credentials</li>
                <li>Rotate NE Account Credentials From File</li>
                <li>Update NE Accounts Configuration</li>
                <li>View Job Details</li>
                <li>View NE Accounts information</li>
                <li>Export of NE Accounts</li>
            </ul>
